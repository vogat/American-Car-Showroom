# American Car Showroom
# Introduction
### The Melting Pot is an innovative restaurant app designed to offer a diverse range of food options and a delightful culinary experience for individuals with a sophisticated palate.

# Hosted App

# Technologies Used
### Front-end
* The app's front-end is developed using the latest web technologies, including CSS, JavaScript, Three.js and React. By leveraging React, I created an efficient and responsive Single Page Application (SPA) that ensures seamless user interactions.

### Back-end
* For the back-end, I employed Express.js and Node.js, enabling the implementation of robust server-side functionalities.

### Database
* The application makes use of MongoDB Atlas as its database, guaranteeing effective storage and retrieval of data to deliver a smooth user experience.

### Deployment
* In order to optimize the deployment process, I employed Render.com. This platform streamlined the app deployment by automatically generating distinct pages for both the front-end and back-end elements. Utilizing Render.com enabled me to effortlessly host and oversee our MERN stack single-page application, resulting in a cohesive user experience throughout the entire journey.

# Features
### 3D Model Animation
* I implemented the 3D animation of a 1970s corvette stingray into my project. This was possible by using Blender to model the car and a combination of Three.js and Webgi to animate the model in the browser

### Create and Manage Cars
* The app empowers users with the ability to create, edit, and delete cars from the database. This allows the user to upload their own personal or favorite cars to the forum!

# Stretch Goals and Next Steps
* Unfortunately there were issues with deployment so the model is not working in the browser. For now I included images from my local hosting of the website
* The Add page also had some css that was disrupted in the deployed app and is not visible due to an opacity value in the CSS.
* Add a user login for the website
* Solve animation issues (can sometimes glitch out)
